__Li-ion Battery Aging Datasets__

   

This data set has been collected from a custom built battery prognostics testbed at the NASA Ames Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE). Li-ion batteries were run through 3 different operational profiles (charge, discharge and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) at different temperatures. Discharges were carried out at different current load levels until the battery voltage fell to preset voltage thresholds. Some of these thresholds were lower than that recommended by the OEM (2.7 V) in order to induce deep discharge aging effects. Repeated charge and discharge cycles result in accelerated aging of the batteries. The experiments were stopped when the batteries reached the end-of-life (EOL) criteria of 30% fade in rated capacity (from 2 Ah to 1.4 Ah).

The data set was provided by the Prognostics CoE at NASA Ames.  
  
The dataset format is in .mat format (matlab) and has been zipped.  

**Intended Use:**

The data sets can serve for a variety of purposes. Because these are essentially a large number of Run-to-Failure time series, the data can be set for development of prognostic algorithms. In particular, due to the differences in depth-of-discharge (DOD), the duration of rest periods and intrinsic variability, no two cells have the same state-of-life (SOL) at the same cycle index. The aim is to be able to manage this uncertainty, which is representative of actual usage, and make reliable predictions of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in both the End-of-Discharge (EOD) and End-of-Life (EOL) contexts.
