Camp Events

June 25-27: Introduction to SQL, Part 1
Never used SQL before? Not a problem! In this three day course we’ll walk through the first part 
of Kaggle’s Intro to SQL course. We’ll use real datasets to get started. You’ll learn the basics 
of how to write SQL queries and practice writing and executing queries using the most important SQL commands. 


July 16-18: Introduction to SQL, Part 2
Now that you’ve got your feet wet, we’ll finish the course together and cover some more complex topics, 
including how to organize the data you get back from your queries and how to join data from multiple tables.


August 7: BigQuery ML one day workshop
Did you know you can train and use machine learning models using only SQL? This is particularly useful if 
you need to train your models on datasets too big to fit in memory. In this one day workshop I’ll introduce 
you to BigQuery ML and walk you through building a simple model. Then try your hand at creating and using a model of your own.


August 27-29: Advanced SQL
In our final event, we’ll work together to tackle the yet-to-be-released Advanced SQL course on Kaggle. 
This course will help you do more things, faster. You’ll learn how to optimize your queries for speed, 
run functions over subsets of your data, join data in lots of useful different ways, and handle nested data structures.

You can do as many or few camp events as you like. I know you’re busy and will keep each day’s activities as 
brief as possible but also make sure you have lots of opportunities to ask questions and discuss things with your fellow campers.

Sounds like fun, right? Make sure you get updates on all the events as they come out.

Register for SQL Summer Camp here!


See you at camp,
