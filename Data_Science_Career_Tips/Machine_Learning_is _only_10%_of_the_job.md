Here's a pretty common misunderstanding.

If you had to guess, what would you say is the most time-consuming part of the data scientist job?
Or in other words, what do you think you’ll need to work on the most when practicing DS for real?

Hint: it's not Machine Learning.
The answer is…
.
.
.
...data cleaning.
Data scientists often say: "80 percent of data science is data cleaning. And 20 percent is complaining about data cleaning." Okay, obviously, that's a joke.

But when you get into your first data science role, you will see for yourself: it's not about doing machine learning and predictive analytics 24/7.

Because to be able to run a proper ML algorithm you have to complete many other steps first:

    data collection
    data formatting
    data cleaning
    transforming your data to the right format
    discovering and understanding the data
    running other analyses
    data visualization
    automating the above steps
    and so on…

And believe me when I say: when you are working with real data, these things are just as exciting as the machine learning and predictive analytics parts.

The point is:
When you prepare for your first DS role, you should not focus on polishing your ML skills. Instead you should focus on:

    being fluent with Python and SQL
    understanding the business logic behind simpler analytical methods
    being familiar with the basics of statistics
    practicing and experiencing the pain of working with a raw and uncleaned data set
    learning how to automate
    and so on...

(I wrote about these in a previous email already.)

These things will help you to become a better data scientist and eventually get your first job -- not another deep learning or artificial intelligence course.

So to summarize:

    __Learning Python and SQL --» important__
    Learning about Deep Learning --» not important
    __Learning the basics of statistics --» important__
    Learning about Artificial Intelligence --» not important
    __Practicing data cleaning, data formatting and automation --» important__
    Understanding "artificial neural networks" --» not important

At least, at the junior level…
Later on (in 1 or 2 years), when your career moves forward, you will have to learn these above-mentioned, fancy machine learning methods on the job, anyway.

But for now: focus on the things that are important for your next step!

PS. if you want to have an exact list of what's important now, take a look at the agenda of the Junior Data Scientist's First Month course here. (Because, obviously, I put together a course that focuses on the important things. :-))

PPS. In my next email, I'll send you a Python Notebook with a sample predictive analytics project in it, to show you what machine learning really means in practice... You will be surprised! ;-)
