Introduction

It was a very important day, the test and project deadline were due next week but you hadn’t prepared much because of the new Halo release. Out of anxiety, you rushed to library and opened your laptop. However, as you lost your sleep leveling up your character, your mind quickly took you to dreamland. Coffee did no avail as you slept soundly in front of your laptop. Time was running short and You were desperate to stay awake.

    What if I tell you… Your laptop could help you stay awake.

The Solution: Drowsiness Detection System (DDS)
And an alarm…

Imagine you were that pitiful guy, you could have activated DDS app installed in your laptop. This would trigger your laptop webcam. Every time you fell drowsy, your laptop would notice and ring an alarm to your headphone. After you woke up,your laptop would notice and turned off the alarm. You could then resume your work.

Cool use case..?
